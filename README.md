## Neural Network from Scratch
Fully functional implementation of a feedforward neural network built from scratch in Python using only NumPy. The code supports customizable architectures with any number of hidden layers, different activation functions (ReLU and sigmoid), and optimizers (SGD, momentum, and Adam). It includes forward and backward propagation, mini-batch training, and performance tracking on training and test sets.
